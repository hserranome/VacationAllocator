# VacationAllocator

VacationAllocator is an application designed to help users plan their vacation days allocation in a year. It takes into account weekends and public holidays based on country to calculate the most straightforward way to allocate vacation days to maximize consecutive days off.

## Features

- **Public Holidays by Country Code**: Users can select the country code for which they want to allocate vacation days. The public holidays are fetch from an external [https://date.nager.at/](API).
- **Customize public holidays**: Users can customize the public holidays by adding or removing specific dates.

## Future Improvements

- **Customizable weekends**: Allow users to specify which days are considered weekends, if any.
- **Better UI/UX**: Improve the user interface and experience to make the application more intuitive and user-friendly.
